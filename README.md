  ## Description 
  This applicaiton lets the user view, add to, or edit information from a database of saved employee data. Once the application is started, using the terminal commands, a database of employees can be created that keeps track of the role, salary, department, id nummber, and manager of the employee. 

  ## Installation 
  The installation process consists of downloading the zip file and extracting all of the included files. Then the user must use the terminal command "npm i" or a functional equivilant to install the necessary packages. Once installed, the data from the schedma.sql file should be used to construct the database within mySQL and following that, the data from seeds.sql can be used optionally to verify the information is showing as intended. Once set up, the use of "node index.js" within the terminal command line will start the prompt for options of application use.

  ## Usage 
  Once installed, use the command "node index.js" to begin the application prompt, displaying the options of application functions. The user uses the arrow keys to highlight the choice of interest and the  enter key to select the option. Selecting to view the data of interest will automatically print out the table of data requested and start over the initial list of options. When choosing to add any information to the database, the prompt will allow text input followed by the enter key to input data. When any task is completetd, the prompt will always be taken back to the initial menu.
